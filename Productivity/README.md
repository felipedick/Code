Conducted a productivity study, analyzing historical data of equipment output per hour (L/H) categorized by SKU. 
The primary objective is to assess if our planning aligns with the desired productivity levels, comparing them against set targets. 
Our analysis encompasses the following key steps:
We scrutinize the distribution of hourly productivity, focusing on identifying the median value for comparison with our targets.
Additionally, we compute hourly productivity rates and assess whether the maximum output aligns with our predefined objectives.
Utilizing the Pareto principle, we identify critical equipment areas warranting focused attention and subsequently devise actionable plans to bolster operational efficiency.
